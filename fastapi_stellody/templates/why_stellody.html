        <p>
          There’s no shortage of so-called “AI playlist generators” online. Most of them offer a mash
          of buzzwords, vague mood sliders, and surface-level Spotify integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s stroll through the actual landscape of <strong>Stellody’s competition</strong> - and why
          Stellody isn’t just better. It’s in a <strong>category of its own</strong>.

    <h2>🏆 Final Summary</h2>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      <strong>"Most playlist generators:"</strong> Tell users what they vaguely want, hit Spotify’s API,
      and hope no one notices they’ve heard it all before.<br />
      <strong>"Stellody:"</strong> Classifies local music with precision. Builds genre-separated playlists.
      Keeps data private. Respects taste.
